# CSCI-250_Final-Project
 The final project for CSCI 250, Fall 2022.


# Instructions
 - Open anaconda or conda prompt or whatever you use to run py scripts.
 - Path to the folder that contains this readme.
 - Run "python scripts/sales_prediction.py"
 - Input the requested data.
    - While you can input any title you want, the publisher and genre should be selected
    from those that are represented in the data we draw on. Ideally, we would implement
    some sort of dropdown in the interface so that the user can't choose a publisher and
    genre that isn't represented in our data.
 - Wait half a second (quite literally) for the prediction to be generated.
 - Enjoy!
